He moved out here to LA over Christmas&mdash;alone, towing a U-Haul&mdash;and found an apartment not far from KFI&#39;s studios, which are in an old part of the Koreatown district, near Wilshire Center.</p>

<p>The <i>John Ziegler Show</i> is the first local, nonsyndicated late-night program that KFI has aired in a long time. It&#39;s something of a gamble for everyone involved. Ten o&#39;clock to one qualifies as late at night in southern California, where hardly anything reputable&#39;s open after nine.</p>

<p>It is currently right near the end of the program&#39;s second segment on the evening of May 11, 2004, shortly after Nicholas Berg&#39;s taped beheading by an al-Qaeda splinter in Iraq. Dressed, as is his custom, for golf, and wearing a white-billed cap w/ corporate logo, Mr. Ziegler is seated by himself in the on-air studio, surrounded by monitors and sheaves of Internet downloads. He is trim, clean-shaven, and <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/51d.html','littlesidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">handsome in the somewhat bland way</a> that top golfers and local TV newsmen tend to be. His eyes, which off-air are usually flat and unhappy, are alight now with passionate conviction. Only some of the studio&#39;s monitors concern Mr. Z.&#39;s own program; the ones up near the ceiling take muted, closed-caption feeds from Fox News, MSNBC, and what might be C-<span style="text-transform: uppercase">SPAN</span>. To his big desk&#39;s upper left is a wall-mounted digital clock that counts down seconds. His computer monitors&#39; displays also show the exact time.</p>

<p>Across the soundproof glass of the opposite wall, another monitor in the Airmix room is running an episode of <i>The Simpsons</i>, also muted, which both the board op and the call screener are watching with half an eye.</p>

<p>Pendent in front of John Ziegler&#39;s face, attached to the same type of hinged, flexible stand as certain student desk lamps, is a Shure-brand broadcast microphone that is sheathed in a gray foam filtration sock to soften popped p&#39;s and hissed sibilants. It is into this microphone that the host speaks:</p>

<p>&quot;And I&#39;ll tell you why&mdash;it&#39;s because we&#39;re <i>better</i> than they are.&quot;</p>

<p>A Georgetown B.A. in government and philosophy, scratch golfer, former TV sportscaster, possible world-class authority on the O.J. Simpson trial, and sometime contributor to MSNBC&#39;s <i>Scarborough Country</i>, Mr. Ziegler is referring here to America versus what he terms &quot;the Arab world.&quot; It&#39;s near the end of his &quot;churn,&quot; which is the industry term for a host&#39;s opening monologue, whose purpose is both to introduce a show&#39;s nightly topics and to get listeners emotionally stimulated enough that they&#39;re drawn into the program and don&#39;t switch away. More than any other mass medium, radio enjoys a captive audience&mdash;if only because so many of the listeners are driving&mdash;but in a major market there are dozens of AM stations to listen to, plus of course FM and satellite radio, and even a very seductive and successful station rarely gets more than a five or six percent audience share.</p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;re not perfect, we suck a lot of the time, but we are <i>better</i> as a people, as a culture, and as a society than they are, and we need to recognize that, so that we can possibly even <i>begin</i> to deal with the evil that we are facing.&quot;</p>

<p>When Mr. Z.&#39;s impassioned, his voice rises and his arms wave around (which obviously only those in the Airmix room can see). He also fidgets, bobs slightly up and down in his executive desk chair, and weaves. Although he must stay seated and can&#39;t pace around the room, the host does not have to keep his mouth any set distance from the microphone, since the board op, &#39;Mondo Hernandez, can adjust his levels on the mixing board&#39;s channel 7 so that Mr. Z.&#39;s volume always stays in range and never peaks or fades. &#39;Mondo, whose price for letting outside parties hang around Airmix is one large bag of cool-ranch Doritos per evening, is an immense twenty-one-year-old man with a ponytail, stony Mesoamerican features, and the placid, grandmotherly eyes common to giant mammals everywhere. Keeping the studio signal from <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/52a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">peaking</a> is one of &#39;Mondo&#39;s prime directives, along with making sure that each of the program&#39;s scheduled commercial spots is loaded into <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/52c.html','littlesidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Prophet</a> and run at just the right time, whereupon he must confirm that the ad has run as scheduled in the special Airmix log he signs each page of, so that the station can bill advertisers for their spots. &#39;Mondo, who started out two years ago as an unpaid intern and now earns ten dollars an hour, works 7:00&mdash;1:00 on weeknights and also board-ops KFI&#39;s special cooking show on Sundays. As long as he&#39;s kept under forty hours a week, which he somehow always just barely is, the station is not obliged to provide &#39;Mondo with employee benefits.</p>

<p>The Nick Berg beheading and its Internet video compose what is known around KFI as a &quot;Monster,&quot; meaning a story that has both high news value and tremendous emotional voltage. As is SOP in political talk radio, the emotions most readily accessed are anger, outrage, indignation, fear, despair, disgust, contempt, and a certain kind of <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/52d.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">apocalyptic glee,</a> all of which the Nick Berg thing&#39;s got in spades. Mr. Ziegler, whose program is in only its fourth month at KFI, has been fortunate in that 2004 has already been chock-full of Monsters&mdash;Saddam&#39;s detention, the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Scott Peterson murder trial, the Greg Haidl gang-rape trial, and preliminary hearings in the rape trial of Kobe Bryant. But tonight is the most angry, indignant, disgusted, and impassioned that Mr. Z.&#39;s gotten on-air so far, and the consensus in Airmix is that it&#39;s resulting in some absolutely first-rate talk radio.</p>

<p>John Ziegler, who is a talk-radio host of unflagging industry, broad general knowledge, mordant wit, and extreme conviction, makes a particular specialty of media criticism. One object of his disgust and contempt in the churn so far has been the U.S. networks&#39; spineless, patronizing decision not to air the Berg videotape and thus to deny Americans &quot;a true and accurate view of the barbarity, the utter <i>depravity</i>, of these people.&quot; Even more outrageous, to Mr. Z., is the mainstream media&#39;s lack of outrage about Berg&#39;s taped murder versus all that same media&#39;s hand-wringing and invective over the recent photos of alleged prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison, which he views as a clear indication of the deluded, blame-America-first mentality of the U.S. press. It is an associated contrast between Americans&#39; mortified response to the Abu Ghraib photos and reports of the Arab world&#39;s phlegmatic reaction to the Berg video that leads to his churn&#39;s climax, which is that we are plainly, unambiguously better than the Arab world&mdash;whereupon John Ziegler invites listeners to respond if they are so moved, repeats the special mnemonic KFI call-in number, and breaks for the :30 news and ads, on time to the second, as &#39;Mondo takes <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/53a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">ISDN feed from Airwatch</a> and the program&#39;s associate producer and call screener, Vince Nicholas&mdash;twenty-six and hiply bald&mdash;pushes back from his console and raises both arms in congratulation, through the glass.</p>

<p icap="on">It goes without saying that there are all different kinds of stimulation. Depending on one&#39;s politics, sensitivities, and tastes in argumentation, it is not hard to think of objections to John Ziegler&#39;s climactic claim, or at least of some urgent requests for clarification. Like: Exactly what and whom does &quot;the Arab world&quot; refer to? And why are a few editorials and man-on-the-street interviews sufficient to represent the attitude and character of a whole diverse region? And why is al-Jazeera&#39;s showing of the Berg video so awful if Mr. Z. has just castigated the U.S. networks for <i>not</i> showing it? Plus, of course, what is &quot;better&quot; supposed to mean here? More moral? More diffident about our immorality? Is it not, in our own history, pretty easy to name some Berg-level atrocities committed by U.S. nationals, or agencies, or even governments, and approved by much of our populace? Or perhaps this: Leaving aside whether John Ziegler&#39;s assertions are true or coherent, is it even remotely helpful or productive to make huge, sweeping claims about some other region&#39;s/culture&#39;s inferiority to us? What possible effect can such remarks have except to incite hatred? Aren&#39;t they sort of irresponsible?</p>

<p>It is true that no one on either side of the studio&#39;s thick window expresses or even alludes to any of these objections. But this is not because Mr. Z.&#39;s support staff is stupid, or hateful, or even necessarily on board with sweeping jingoistic claims. It is because they understand the particular codes and imperatives of large-market talk radio. The fact of the matter is that it is not John Ziegler&#39;s job to be responsible, or nuanced, or to think about whether his on-air comments are productive or dangerous, or cogent, or even defensible. That is not to say that the host would not defend his &quot;we&#39;re better&quot;&mdash;strenuously&mdash;or that he does not believe it&#39;s true. It is to say that he has exactly one on-air job, and that is to be <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/53b.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">stimulating.</a> An obvious point, but it&#39;s one that&#39;s often overlooked by people who complain about propaganda, misinformation, and irresponsibility in commercial talk radio. Whatever else they are, the above-type objections to &quot;We&#39;re better than the Arab world&quot; are calls to accountability. They are the sort of criticisms one might make of, say, a journalist, someone whose job description includes being responsible about what he says in public. And KFI&#39;s John Ziegler is not a journalist&mdash;he is <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/53c.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">an entertainer.</a> Or maybe it&#39;s better to say that he is part of a peculiar, <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/53d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">modern,</a> and very popular type of news industry, one that manages to enjoy the authority and influence of journalism without the stodgy constraints of fairness, objectivity, and responsibility that make trying to tell the truth such a drag for everyone involved. It is a frightening industry, though not for any of the simple reasons most critics give.</p>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

<p icap="on">Distributed over two walls of KFI&#39;s broadcast studio, behind the monitors and clocks, are a dozen promotional KFI posters, all in the station&#39;s eye-catching <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/54a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Halloween colors against the Sweeper&#39;s bright white.</a> On each poster, the word &quot;stimulating&quot; is both italicized and underscored. Except for the door and soundproof window, the entire studio is lined in acoustic tile with strange Pollockian patterns of tiny holes. Much of the tile is grayed and decaying, and the carpet&#39;s no color at all; KFI has been in this facility for nearly thirty years and will soon be moving out. Both the studio and Airmix are kept chilly because of all the electronics. The overhead lights are old inset fluorescents, the kind with the slight flutter to them; nothing casts any sort of shadow. On one of the studio walls is also pinned the <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/54b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">special set of playing cards</a> distributed for the invasion of Iraq, these with hand-drawn Xs over the faces of those Baathists captured or killed so far. The great L-shaped table that Mr. Z. sits at nearly fills the little room; it&#39;s got so many coats of brown paint on it that the tabletop looks slightly humped. At the L&#39;s base is another Shure microphone, used by Ken Chiampou of 3:00&mdash;7:00&#39;s <i>John &amp; Ken</i>, its hinged stand now partly folded up so that the mike hangs like a wilted flower. The oddest thing about the studio is a strong scent of decaying bananas, as if many peels or even whole bananas were rotting in the room&#39;s wastebaskets, none of which look to have been emptied anytime recently. Mr. Ziegler, who has his <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/54c.html','littlesidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">ascetic</a> side, drinks only bottled water in the studio, and certainly never snacks, so there is no way he is the source of the banana smell.</p>

<a class="arc" href="/doc/200501/powers">&quot;The Massless Media&quot;</a> (January/February 2005)<br />
With the mass media losing their audience to smaller, more targeted outlets, we may be headed for an era of noisy, contentious press reminiscent of the 1800s. By William Powers </font></div>

<p icap="on">It is worth considering the strange media landscape in which political talk radio is a salient. Never before have there been so many different national news sources&mdash;different now in terms of both medium and ideology. Major newspapers from anywhere are available online; there are the broadcast networks plus public TV, cable&#39;s CNN, Fox News, CNBC, et al., print and Web magazines, Internet bulletin boards, <i>The Daily Show</i>, e-mail newsletters, blogs. All this is well known; it&#39;s part of the Media Environment we live in. But there are prices and ironies here. One is that the increasing control of U.S. mass media by a mere handful of corporations has&mdash;rather counterintuitively&mdash;created a situation of extreme fragmentation, a kaleidoscope of information options. Another is that the ever increasing number of ideological news outlets creates precisely the kind of relativism that cultural conservatives decry, a kind of epistemic free-for-all in which &quot;the truth&quot; is wholly a matter of perspective and agenda. In some respects all this variety is probably good, productive of difference and dialogue and so on. But it can also be confusing and stressful for the average citizen. Short of signing on to a particular mass ideology and patronizing only those partisan news sources that ratify what you <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/54d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">want to believe,</a> it is increasingly hard to determine which sources to pay attention to and how exactly to <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/54e.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">distinguish real information from spin.</a></p>

<p>This fragmentation and confusion have helped give rise to what&#39;s variously called the &quot;meta-media&quot; or &quot;explaining industry.&quot; Under most classifications, this category includes media critics for news dailies, certain high-end magazines, panel shows like CNN&#39;s <i>Reliable Sources</i>, media-watch blogs like instapundit.com and talkingpointsmemo.com, and a large percentage of political talk radio. It is no accident that one of the signature lines Mr. Ziegler likes to deliver over his opening bumper music at :06 is &quot;&hellip; the show where we take a look at the news of the day, we provide you the facts, and then we give you the truth.&quot; For this is how much of contemporary political talk radio understands its function: to explore the day&#39;s news in a depth and detail that other media do not, and to interpret, analyze, and explain that news.</p>

<p>Which all sounds great, except of course &quot;explaining&quot; the news really means editorializing, infusing the actual events of the day with the host&#39;s own opinions. And here is where the real controversy starts, because these opinions are, as just one person&#39;s opinions, exempt from strict journalistic standards of truthfulness, probity, etc., and yet they are often delivered by the talk-radio host not as opinions but as revealed truths, truths intentionally ignored or suppressed by a &quot;mainstream press&quot; that&#39;s &quot;biased&quot; in favor of liberal interests. This is, at any rate, the rhetorical template for Rush Limbaugh&#39;s program, <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/55a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">on which most syndicated and large-market political talk radio is modeled,</a> from ABC&#39;s Sean Hannity and Talk Radio Network&#39;s Laura Ingraham to G.

Dr. Laura&#39;s counsel is caustic and oftentimes hypocritical, but it is also persuasive. By Caitlin Flanagan </font></div>

<p>KFI AM-640 carries Rush Limbaugh every weekday, 9:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">a.m.</span> to noon, via live ISDN feed from Premiere Radio Networks, which is one of the dozen syndication networks that own talk-radio shows so popular that it&#39;s worth it for local stations to air them even though it costs the stations a portion of their <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/55e.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">spot load.</a> The same goes for Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who&#39;s based in southern California and <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/55f.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">used to broadcast her syndicated show from KFI</a> until the mid-nineties, when Premiere built its own LA facility and was able to offer Schlessinger more-sumptuous digs.

Besides 7:00&mdash;10:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">p.m.</span>&#39;s Phil Hendrie (another KFI host whose show went into national syndication, and who now has his own private dressing room and studio over at Premiere), the only other weekday syndication KFI uses is <i>Coast to Coast With George Noory</i>, which covers and analyzes news of the paranormal throughout the wee hours.</p>

<p icap="on">Whatever the social effects of talk radio or the partisan agendas of certain hosts, it is a fallacy that political talk radio is motivated by ideology. It is not. Political talk radio is a business, and it is motivated by revenue. The conservatism that dominates today&#39;s AM airwaves does so because it generates high Arbitron ratings, high ad rates, and maximum profits.</p>

<p>Radio has become a more lucrative business than most people know. Throughout most of the past decade, the industry&#39;s revenues have increased by more than 10 percent a year. The average cash-flow margin for major radio companies is 40 percent, compared with more like 15 percent for large TV networks; and the mean price paid for a radio station has gone from eight to more than thirteen times cash flow. Some of this extreme profitability, and thus the structure of the industry, is due to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which allows radio companies to acquire up to eight stations in a given market and to control as much as 35 percent of a market&#39;s total ad revenues. The emergence of huge, dominant radio conglomerates like Clear Channel and Infinity is a direct consequence of the &#39;96 Act (which the FCC, aided by the very conservative D.C. Court of Appeals, has lately tried to make even more permissive). And these radio conglomerates enjoy not just substantial economies of scale but almost unprecedented degrees of business integration.</p>

<p>Example: Clear Channel Communications Inc. now <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">owns KFI AM-640,</a> plus two other AM stations and five FMs in the Los Angeles market.<a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58b.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>It also owns <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58e.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Premiere Radio Networks.</a> It also owns the Airwatch subscription news/traffic service. And it designs and manufactures Prophet, KFI&#39;s operating system, which is state-of-the-art and much too expensive for most independent stations. All told, Clear Channel currently owns some 1,200 radio stations nationwide, one of which happens to be Louisville, Kentucky&#39;s WHAS, the AM talk station from which John Ziegler was fired, amid spectacular gossip and controversy, in August of 2003. Which means that Mr. Ziegler now works in Los Angeles for the same company that just fired him in Louisville, such that his firing now appears&mdash;in retrospect, and considering the relative sizes of the Louisville and LA markets&mdash;to have been a promotion. All of which turns out to be a strange and revealing story about what a talk-radio host&#39;s life is like.</p>

<p icap="on">For obvious reasons, critics of political talk radio concern themselves mainly with the programs&#39; content. Talk station management, on the other hand, tends to think of content as a subset of personality, of how stimulating a given host is. As for the hosts&mdash;ask Mr. Ziegler off-air what makes him good at his job, and he&#39;ll shrug glumly and say, &quot;I&#39;m not really all that talented. <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">I&#39;ve got passion,</a> and I work really hard.&quot; Taken so for granted that nobody in the business seems aware of it is something that an outsider, sitting in Airmix and watching John Ziegler at the microphone, will notice right away. Hosting talk radio is an exotic, high-pressure gig that not many people are fit for, and being truly good at it requires skills so specialized that many of them don&#39;t have names.</p>

<p>To appreciate these skills and some of the difficulties involved, you might wish to do an experiment. Try sitting alone in a room with a clock, turning on a tape recorder, and starting to speak into it. Speak about anything you want&mdash;with the proviso that your topic, and your opinions on it, must be of interest to some group of strangers who you imagine will be listening to the tape. Naturally, in order to be even minimally interesting, your remarks should be intelligible and their reasoning sequential&mdash;a listener will have to be able to follow the logic of what you&#39;re saying&mdash;which means that you will have to know enough about your topic to organize your statements in a coherent way. (But you cannot do much of this organizing beforehand; it has <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58g.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">to occur at the same time you&#39;re speaking.</a>) Plus, ideally, what you&#39;re saying should be not just comprehensible and interesting but compelling, stimulating, which means that your remarks have to provoke and sustain some kind of <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/58h.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">emotional reaction</a> in the listeners, which in turn will require you to construct some kind of identifiable persona for yourself&mdash;your comments will need to strike the listener as coming from an <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/59a.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">actual human being,</a> someone with a real personality and real feelings about whatever it is you&#39;re discussing. And it gets even trickier: You&#39;re trying to communicate in real time with someone you cannot see or hear responses from; and though you&#39;re communicating in speech, your remarks cannot have any of the fragmentary, repetitive, garbled qualities of real interhuman speech, or speech&#39;s ticcy unconscious &quot;umm&quot;s or &quot;you know&quot;s, or false starts or stutters or long pauses while you try to think of how to phrase what you want to say next. You&#39;re also, of course, denied the physical inflections that are so much a part of spoken English&mdash;the facial expressions, changes in posture, and symphony of little gestures that accompany and buttress real talking. Everything unspoken about you, your topic, and how you feel about it has to be conveyed through pitch, volume, tone, and pacing. The pacing is especially important: it can&#39;t be too slow, since that&#39;s low-energy and dull, but it can&#39;t be too rushed or it will sound like babbling. And so you have somehow to keep all these different imperatives and structures in mind at the same time, while also filling exactly, say, eleven minutes, with no dead air and <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/59c.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">no going over, such that at 10:46 you have wound things up neatly</a> and are in a position to say, &quot;KFI is the station with the most frequent traffic reports.

So then, ready: go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no joke. See for example the <i>John Ziegler Show</i>&#39;s producer, Emiliano Limon, who broke in at KFI as a weekend overnight host before moving across the glass:</p>

<p>&quot;What&#39;s amazing is that when you get new people who think that they can do a talk-radio program, you watch them for the first time. By three minutes into it, they have that look on their face like, &#39;Oh my God, I&#39;ve got ten minutes left. What am I going to say?&#39; And that&#39;s what happened to me a lot. So you end up talking about yourself [which, for complex philosophical reasons, the producer disapproves of], or you end up yammering.&quot; Emiliano is a large, very calm and competent man in his mid-thirties who either wears the same black <i>LA Times</i> T-shirt every day or owns a whole closetful of them. He was pulled off other duties to help launch KFI&#39;s experimental Live and Local evening show, an assignment that obviously involves working closely with Mr. Z., which Emiliano seems to accept as his karmic punishment for being so unflappable and easy to get along with. He laughs more than everyone else at KFI put together.</p>

<p>&quot;I remember one time, I just broke after five minutes, I was just done, and they were going, &#39;Hey, what are you doing, you have another ten minutes!&#39; And I was like, &#39;I don&#39;t know what else to say!&#39; And that&#39;s what happens. For those people who think &#39;Oh, I could do talk radio,&#39; well, there&#39;s more to it. A lot of people can&#39;t take it once they get that taste of, you know, &#39;Geez, I gotta fill all this time <i>and</i> sound interesting?&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, as you keep on doing it over the days, there&#39;s something that becomes absolutely clear to you. You&#39;re not really acting on the radio. It&#39;s <i>you</i>. If no one really responds and the ratings aren&#39;t good, it means they don&#39;t like <i>you</i>.&quot; Which is worth keeping very much in mind.</p>

<p icap="on">An abiding question: Who exactly listens to political talk radio? Arbitron Inc. and some of its satellites can help measure how many are listening for how long and when, and they provide some rough age data and demographic specs. A lot of the rest is guesswork, and Program Directors don&#39;t like to talk about it.</p>

<p>From outside, though, one of the best clues to how a radio station understands its audience is spots. Which commercials it runs, and when, indicate how the station is <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/60a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">pitching its listeners&#39; tastes and receptivities to sponsors.</a> In how often particular spots are repeated lie clues to the length of time the station thinks people are listening, how attentive it thinks they are, etc. Specific example: Just from its spot load, we can deduce that KFI trusts its audience to sit still for an extraordinary amount of advertising. An average hour of the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> consists of four program segments: :06&ndash;:17, :23&ndash;:30, :37&ndash;:46, and :53&ndash;:00, or thirty-four minutes of Mr. Z. actually talking. Since KFI&#39;s newscasts are never more than ninety seconds, and since quarterly traffic reports are always bracketed by <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/60c.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;live-read&quot; spots</a> for Traffic Center sponsors, that makes each hour at least 40 percent ads; the percentage is higher if you count Sweepers for the station and promos for other KFI shows. And this is the load just on a local program, one for which the Clock doesn&#39;t have to be split with a syndicator.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that KFI&#39;s unaware of the dangers here. Station management reads its mail, and as Emiliano Limon puts it, &quot;If there&#39;s one complaint listeners always have, it&#39;s the spot load.&quot; But the only important issue is whether all the complaints translate into actual listener behavior. KFI&#39;s spot load is an instance of the kind of multivariable maximization problem that M.B.A. programs thrive on. It is obviously in the station&#39;s financial interest to carry just as high a volume of ads as it can without hurting ratings&mdash;the moment listeners begin turning away from KFI because of too many commercials, the Arbitron numbers go down, the rates charged for ads have to be reduced, and <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/60f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">profitability suffers.</a> But anything more specific is, again, guesswork. When asked about management&#39;s thinking here, or whether there&#39;s any particular formula KFI uses to figure out how high a spot load the <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/60g.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">market</a> will bear, Ms. Bertolucci will only smile and shrug as if pleasantly stumped: &quot;We have more commercials than we&#39;ve ever had, and our ratings are the best they&#39;ve ever been.&quot;</p>

<p>How often a particular spot can run over and over before listeners just can&#39;t stand it anymore is something else no one will talk about, but the evidence suggests that KFI sees its audience as either very patient and tolerant or almost catatonically inattentive. Canned ads for local sponsors like Robbins Bros. Jewelers, Sit &#39;n Sleep Mattress, and the Power Auto Group play every couple hours, 24/7, until one knows every hitch and nuance. National saturation campaigns for products like Cortislim vary things somewhat by using both endorsements and canned spots. Pitches for caveat emptor&mdash;type nostrums like Avacor (for hair loss), <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/62a.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Enzyte</a> (&quot;For natural male enhancement!&quot;), and <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/62a.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Altovis</a> (&quot;Helps fight daily fatigue!&quot;) often repeat once an hour through the night. As of spring &#39;04, though, the most frequent and concussive ads on KFI are for mortgage and home-refi companies&mdash;Green Light Financial, HMS Capital, Home Field Financial, Benchmark Lending. Over and over. Pacific Home Financial, U.S. Mortgage Capital, Crestline Funding, Advantix Lending. Reverse mortgages, negative amortization, adjustable rates, APR, <span style="text-transform: uppercase">FICO</span> &hellip; where did all these firms come from? What were these guys doing five years ago? Why is KFI&#39;s audience seen as so especially ripe and ready for refi? Betterloans.com, lendingtree.com, Union Bank of California, on and on and on.</p>

<p icap="on">Emiliano Limon&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s <i>you</i>&quot; seems true to an extent. But there is also the issue of persona, meaning the on-air personality that a host adopts in order <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/62d.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">to heighten the sense</a> of a real person behind the mike. It is, after all, unlikely that Rush Limbaugh always feels as jaunty and confident as he seems on the air, or that Howard Stern really is deeply fascinated by porn starlets every waking minute of the day. But a host&#39;s persona is not the same as outright acting. For the most part, it&#39;s probably more like the way we are all slightly different with some people than we are with others.</p>

<p>In some cases, though, the personas are more contrived and extreme. In the slot preceding Mr. Z.&#39;s on KFI, for instance, is the <i>Phil Hendrie Show</i>, which is actually a cruel and complicated kind of meta&mdash;talk radio. What happens every night on this program is that Phil Hendrie brings on some wildly offensive guest&mdash;a man who&#39;s leaving his wife because she&#39;s had a mastectomy, a Little League coach who advocates corporal punishment of players, a retired colonel who claims that females&#39; only proper place in the military is as domestics and concubines for the officers&mdash;and first-time or casual listeners will call in and argue with the guests and (not surprisingly) get very angry and upset. Except the whole thing&#39;s a put-on. The guests are fake, their different voices done by <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/62e.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Hendrie</a> with the aid of mike processing and a first-rate board op, and the show&#39;s real entertainment is the callers, who don&#39;t know it&#39;s all a gag&mdash;Hendrie&#39;s real audience, which is in on the joke, <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/62f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">enjoys hearing these callers</a> get more and more outraged and sputtery as the &quot;guests&quot; yank their chain. It&#39;s all a bit like the old <i>Candid Camera</i> if the joke perpetrated over and over on that show were convincing somebody that a loved one had just died. So obviously Hendrie&mdash;whose show now draws an estimated one million listeners a week&mdash;lies on the outer frontier of radio persona.</p>

<p>A big part of John Ziegler&#39;s on-air persona, on the other hand, is that he doesn&#39;t have one. This may be just a function of all the time he&#39;s spent in the abattoir of small-market radio, but in Los Angeles it plays as a canny and sophisticated meta-radio move. Part of his January introduction to himself and his program is &quot;The key to the <i>John Ziegler Show</i> is that I am almost completely real. Nearly every show begins with the credo &#39;This is the show where the host says what he believes and believes what he says.&#39; I do not make up my opinions or exaggerate my stories simply to stir the best debate on that particular broadcast.&quot;</p>

<p>Though Mr. Z. won&#39;t ever quite say so directly, his explicit I-have-no-persona persona helps to establish a contrast with weekday afternoons&#39; John Kobylt, whose on-air voice is similar to Ziegler&#39;s <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/64a.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">in pitch and timbre.</a> Kobylt and his sidekick Ken Chiampou have a hugely popular show based around finding stories and causes that will make white, middle-class Californians feel angry and disgusted, and then hammering away at these stories/causes day after day. Their personas are what the <i>LA Times</i> calls &quot;brash&quot; and Chiampou himself calls &quot;rabid dogs,&quot; which latter KFI has developed into the promo line &quot;The Junkyard Dogs of Talk Radio.&quot; What John &amp; Ken really are is professional oiks. Their show is credited with helping jump-start the &#39;03 campaign to recall Governor Gray Davis, although they were equally disgusted by most of the candidates who wanted to replace him (q.v. Kobylt: &quot;If there&#39;s anything <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/64c.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">I don&#39;t like more than politicians,</a> it&#39;s those wormy little nerds who act as campaign handlers and staff &hellip; We just happened to on our own decide that Davis was a rotting stool that ought to be flushed&quot;). In &#39;02, they organized a parade of SUVs in Sacramento to protest stricter vehicle-emissions laws; this year they spend at least an hour a day attacking various government officials and their spokesholes for failing to enforce immigration laws and trying to bullshit the citizens about it; and so on. But the <i>John &amp; Ken Show</i>&#39;s real specialty is gruesome, high-profile California trials, which they often cover on-site, Kobylt eschewing all PC pussyfooting and legal niceties to speak his mind about defendants like 2002&#39;s David Westerfield and the current Scott Peterson, both <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/64e.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;scumbags that are guilty as sin.&quot;</a> The point is that John Kobylt broadcasts in an almost perpetual state of affronted rage; and, as more than one KFI staffer has ventured to observe off the record, it&#39;s unlikely that any middle-aged man could really go around this upset all the time and not drop dead. It&#39;s a persona, in other words, not exactly fabricated but certainly exaggerated &hellip; and of course it&#39;s also demagoguery of the most classic and unabashed sort.</p>

<p>But it makes for stimulating and <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/65a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">profitable</a> talk radio. As of Arbitron&#39;s winter &#39;04 Book, KFI AM-640 has become the No. 1 talk station in the country, beating out New York&#39;s WABC in both <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/65b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Cume and AQH</a> for the coveted 25&mdash;54 audience. KFI also now has the second highest market share of any radio station in Los Angeles, trailing only hip-hop giant KPWR. In just one year, KFI has gone from being the eighteenth to the seventh top-billing station in the country, which is part of why it received the 2003 News/Talk Station of the Year Award from <i>Radio and Records</i> magazine. Much of this recent success is attributed to Ms. Robin Bertolucci, the Program Director brought in from Denver shortly after Clear Channel acquired KFI, whom Mr. Z. describes as &quot;a real superstar in the business right now.&quot; From all reports, Ms. Bertolucci has done everything from redesigning the station&#39;s ID and Sweeper and sound and overall in-your-face vibe to helping established hosts fine-tune their personas and create a distinctively KFI-ish style and &#39;tude for their shows.</p>

<p>Every Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Bertolucci meets with John Ziegler to review the previous week and chat about how the show&#39;s going. The Program Director&#39;s large private office is located just off the KFI prep room (where Mr. Z.&#39;s own office is a small computer table with a homemade <span style="text-transform: uppercase">THIS AREA RESERVED FOR JOHN ZIEGLER</span> taped to it). Ms. B. is soft-spoken, polite, unpretentious, and almost completely devoid of moving parts. Here is her on-record explanation of the Program Director&#39;s role w/r/t the <i>John Ziegler Show</i>:</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s John&#39;s show. He&#39;s flying the airplane, a big 747. What I am, I&#39;m the little person in the control tower. I have a different perspective&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>have</i> no perspective!&quot; Mr. Z. interrupts, with a loud laugh, from his seat before her desk.</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;which might be of value. Like, &#39;You may want to pull up because you&#39;re heading for a mountain.&#39;&quot; They both laugh. It&#39;s an outrageous bit of understatement: nine months ago John Ziegler&#39;s career was rubble, and Ms. B. is the only reason he&#39;s here, and she&#39;s every inch his boss, and he&#39;s nervous around her&mdash;which you can tell by the way he puts his long legs out and leans back in his chair with his hands in his slacks&#39; pockets and yawns a lot and tries to look <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/65c.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">exaggeratedly relaxed.</a></p>

<p>The use of some esoteric technical slang occasions a brief Q &amp; A on how exactly <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/65d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Arbitron</a> works, while Mr. Z. joggles his sneaker impatiently. Then they go over the past week. Ms. B. gently chides the new host for not hitting the Greg Haidl trial harder, and for usually discussing the case in his show&#39;s second hour instead of the first. Her thrust: &quot;It&#39;s a big story for us. It&#39;s got sex, it&#39;s got police, class issues, kids running amok, video, the courts, and who gets away with what. And it&#39;s in Orange County.&quot; When Mr. Ziegler (whose off-air method of showing annoyance or frustration is to sort of hang his head way over to one side) protests that both Bill Handel and John &amp; Ken have already covered the story six ways from Sunday every day and there is no way for him to do anything fresh or stimulating with it, Ms. B. nods slowly and responds: &quot;If we were KIIS-FM, and we had a new Christina Aguilera song, and they played it heavy on the morning show and the afternoon show, wouldn&#39;t you still play it on the evening show?&quot; At which Mr. Z. sort of lolls his head from side to side several times&mdash;&quot;All right. I see your point. All right&quot;&mdash;and on tonight&#39;s (i.e., May 19&#39;s) program he does lead with and spend much of the first hour on the <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/66a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">latest Haidl developments.</a></p>

<p>By way of post-meeting analysis, it is worth noting that a certain assumption behind Ms. B.&#39;s Christina Aguilera analogy&mdash;namely, that a criminal trial is every bit as much an entertainment product as a Top 40 song&mdash;was not questioned or even blinked at by either participant. This is doubtless one reason for KFI&#39;s ratings &eacute;clat&mdash;the near total conflation of news and entertainment. It also explains why KFI&#39;s twice-hourly newscasts (which are always extremely short, and densely interwoven with station promos and live-read ads) concentrate so heavily on lurid, tabloidish stories. Post&mdash;Nick Berg, the station&#39;s newscasts in May and early June tend to lead with child-molestation charges against local clerics and teachers, revelations in the Peterson and Haidl trials, and developments in the Kobe Bryant and Michael Jackson cases. With respect to Ms. Bertolucci&#39;s on-record description of KFI&#39;s typical listener&mdash;&quot;An information-seeking person that wants to know what&#39;s going on in the world and wants to be communicated to in an interesting, entertaining, stimulating sort of way&quot;&mdash;it seems fair to observe that KFI provides a peculiar and very selective view of what&#39;s going on in the world.</p>

<p>Ms. B.&#39;s description turns out to be loaded in a number of ways. The role of news and information versus personal and persona-driven stuff on the <i>John Ziegler Show</i>, for example, is a matter that Mr. Z. and his producer see very differently. Emiliano Limon, who&#39;s worked at the station for over a decade and believes he knows its audience, sees &quot;two distinct <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/66b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">eras at KFI.</a> The first was the opinion-driven, personal, here&#39;s-my-take-on-things era. The second is the era we&#39;re in right now, putting the information first.&quot; Emiliano refers to polls he&#39;s seen indicating that most people in southern California get their news from local TV newscasts and Jay Leno&#39;s monologue on <i>the Tonight show</i>. &quot;We go on the presumption that the average driver, average listener, isn&#39;t reading the news the way we are. We read <i>everything</i>.&quot; In fact, this voracious news-reading is a big part of Emiliano&#39;s job. He is, like most talk-radio producers, a virtuoso on the Internet, and he combs through a daily list of sixty national papers, &#39;zines, and blogs, and he believes that his and KFI&#39;s main function is to provide &quot;a kind of <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/66c.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">executive news summary</a>&quot; for busy listeners.

The first of these involved AM music stations&#39; getting absolutely murdered by FM, which could broadcast music in stereo and allowed for much better fidelity on high and low notes. The human voice, on the other hand, is mid-range and doesn&#39;t require high fidelity. The eighties&#39; proliferation of talk formats on the AM band also provided new careers for some music deejays&mdash;e.g., Don Imus, Morton Downey Jr.&mdash;whose chatty personas didn&#39;t fit well with FM&#39;s all-about-the-music ethos.</p>

<p>The second big factor was the repeal, late in Ronald Reagan&#39;s second term, of what was known as the Fairness Doctrine. This was a 1949 FCC rule designed to minimize any possible restrictions on free speech caused by limited access to broadcasting outlets. The idea was that, as one of the conditions for receiving an FCC broadcast license, a station had to &quot;devote reasonable attention to the coverage of controversial issues of public importance,&quot; and consequently had to provide &quot;reasonable, although not necessarily equal&quot; opportunities for opposing sides to express their views. Because of the Fairness Doctrine, talk stations had to hire and program symmetrically: if you had a three-hour program whose host&#39;s politics were on one side of the ideological spectrum, you had to have another long-form program whose host more or less spoke for the other side. Weirdly enough, up through the mid-eighties it was usually the U.S. right that benefited most from the Doctrine. Pioneer talk syndicator Ed McLaughlin, who managed <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/67a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">San Francisco&#39;s KGO</a> in the 1960s, recalls that &quot;I had more liberals on the air than I had conservatives or even moderates for that matter, and I had a hell of a time finding the other voice.&quot;</p>

<p>The Fairness Doctrine&#39;s repeal was part of the sweeping deregulations of the Reagan era, which aimed to liberate all sorts of industries from government interference and allow them to compete freely in the marketplace. The old, Rooseveltian logic of the Doctrine had been that since the airwaves belonged to everyone, a license to profit from those airwaves conferred on the broadcast industry some special obligation to serve the public interest. Commercial radio broadcasting was not, in other words, originally conceived as just another for-profit industry; it was supposed to meet a higher standard of social responsibility. After 1987, though, just another industry is pretty much what radio became, and its <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/67b.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">only real responsibility now</a> is to attract and retain listeners in order to generate revenue. In other words, the sort of distinction explicitly drawn by FCC Chairman Newton Minow in the 1960s&mdash;namely, that between &quot;the public interest&quot; and &quot;merely what interests the public&quot;&mdash;no longer exists.<a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/67c.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>More or less on the heels of the Fairness Doctrine&#39;s repeal came the West Coast and then national syndication of <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/67e.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink"><i>The Rush Limbaugh Show</i></a> through Mr. McLaughlin&#39;s <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/67f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">EFM Media.</a> Limbaugh is the third great progenitor of today&#39;s political talk radio partly because he&#39;s a host of extraordinary, once-in-a-generation talent and charisma&mdash;bright, loquacious, witty, complexly authoritative&mdash;whose show&#39;s blend of news, entertainment, and partisan analysis became the model for legions of imitators.

<p icap="on">In the best Rush Limbaugh tradition, Mr. Ziegler takes pride in his on-air sense of humor. His media criticism is often laced with wisecracks, and he likes to leaven his show&#39;s political and cultural analyses with timely ad-lib gags, such as &quot;It&#39;s maybe a good thing that Catholics and Muslims don&#39;t tend to marry. If they had a kid, he&#39;d grow up and then, what, abuse some child and then blow him up?&quot; And he has a penchant for comic maxims (&quot;Fifty percent of all marriages are confirmed failures, while the other fifty percent end in divorce&quot;; &quot;The female figure is the greatest known evidence that there might be a God, but the female psyche is an indication that this God has a very sick sense of humor&quot;) that he uses on the air and then catalogues as &quot;Zieglerisms&quot; on <a class="magbodylink" href="http://www.johnziegler.com/" target="outlink">his KFI Web site</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Z. can also, when time and the demands of prep permit, go long-form. In his program&#39;s final hour for May 22, he delivers a mock commencement address to the Class of 2004, a piece of prepared sit-down comedy that is worth excerpting, verbatim, as a sort of keyhole into the professional psyche of Mr. John Ziegler:</p>

<blockquote>Class of 2004, congratulations on graduation &hellip; I wish to let you in on a few secrets that those of you <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/68c.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">who are not completely brain-dead</a> will eventually figure out on your own, but, if you listen to me, will save a lot of time and frustration. First of all, most of what you have been taught in your academic career is not true. I am not just talking about the details of history that have been distorted to promote the liberal agenda of academia. I am also referring to the big-picture lessons of life as well. The sad truth is that, contrary to what most of you have been told, <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/68d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">you <i>cannot</i> do or be anything you want.</a> The vast majority of you &hellip; will be absolutely miserable in whatever career you choose or are forced to endure. You will most likely hate your boss because they will most likely be dumber than you think you are, and they will inevitably screw you at every chance they get &hellip; The boss will not be the only stupid person you encounter in life. The vast majority of people are <i>much</i>, <i>much</i> dumber than you have ever been led to believe. Never forget this. And just like people are far dumber than you have been led to believe, they are also <i>far</i> more dishonest than anyone is seemingly willing to admit to you. If you have any doubt as to whether someone is telling you the truth, it is a safe bet to assume that they are lying to you &hellip; Do not trust anyone unless you have some sort of significant leverage over him or her and they <i>know</i> that you have that leverage over them. Unless this condition exists, anyone&mdash;and I mean <i>anyone</i>&mdash;can and probably will stab you in the back.</blockquote>

<p>That is about one sixth of the address, and for the most part it speaks for itself.</p>

<p>One of many intriguing things about Mr. Ziegler, though, is the contrast between his deep cynicism about backstabbing and the naked, seemingly self-destructive <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/68f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">candor with which he&#39;ll discuss his life and career.</a> This candor becomes almost paradoxical in Q &amp; As with an <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/69a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">outside correspondent,</a> a stranger whom Mr. Z. has no particular reason to trust at those times when he winces after saying something and asks that it be struck from the record.

<blockquote>1967&ndash;1989: Mr. John Ziegler grows up in suburban Philadelphia, the elder son of a financial manager and a homemaker. All kinds of unsummarizable evidence indicates that Mr. Z. and his mother are very close. In 1984, he is named High School Golfer of the Year by the <i>Bucks County Courier Times</i>. He&#39;s also a three-year golf letterman at Georgetown, where his liberal arts studies turn out to be &quot;a great way to prepare for a life of being unemployed, which I&#39;ve done quite a bit of.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>1989&ndash;1995: Mr. Z.&#39;s original career is in local TV sports. He works for stations in and around Washington DC, in Steubenville OH, and finally in Raleigh NC. Though sports news is what he&#39;s wanted to do ever since he was a little boy, <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/69c.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">he hates the jobs</a>: &quot;The whole world of sports and local news is so disgusting &hellip; local TV news is half a step above prostitution.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>1994&ndash;1995: Both personally and professionally, this period constitutes a dark night of the soul for John Ziegler. Summer &#39;94: O.J. Simpson&#39;s ex-wife is brutally murdered. Fall &#39;94: Mr. Ziegler&#39;s mother is killed in a car crash. Winter &#39;95: During his sportscast, Mr. Z. makes &quot;an incredibly tame joke about O.J. Simpson&#39;s lack of innocence&quot; w/r/t his wife&#39;s murder, which draws some protest from Raleigh&#39;s black community. John Ziegler is eventually fired from WLFL because the station &quot;caved in to Political Correctness.&quot; The whole nasty incident marks the start of (a) Mr. Z.&#39;s deep, complex hatred for all things PC, and (b) &quot;my history with O.J.&quot; He falls into a deep funk, decides to give up sports broadcasting, &quot;pretty much gave up on life, actually.&quot; Mr. Z. spends his days watching the O.J. Simpson trial on cable television, often sitting through repeat broadcasts of the coverage late at night; and when O.J. is finally acquitted, &quot;I was nearly suicidal.&quot; Two psychiatrist golf buddies talk him into going on antidepressants, but much of the time O.J. is still all Mr. Ziegler can think and talk about. &quot;It got so bad&mdash;<a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/69d.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">you&#39;ll find this funny</a>&mdash;at one point I was so depressed that it was my goal, assuming that he&#39;d be acquitted and that [O.J.&#39;s] Riviera Country Club wouldn&#39;t have the guts to kick him out, that I was going to become a caddy at Riviera, knock him off, and see whether or not [a certain lawyer Mr. Z. also played golf with, whose name is here omitted] could get me off on jury nullification. That&#39;s how obsessed I was.&quot; The lawyer/golfer/friend&#39;s reaction to this plan is not described.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Late 1995: Mr. Z. decides to give life and broadcasting another shot. Figuring that &quot;maybe my controversial nature would work better on talk radio,&quot; he takes a job as a weekend fill-in host for a station in Fuquay-Varina NC&mdash;&quot;the worst talk-radio station on the planet &hellip; to call the station owner a redneck was insulting to rednecks&quot;&mdash;only to be abruptly fired when the station switches to an automated Christian-music format.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Early 1996: &quot;I bought, actually <i>bought</i>, time on a Raleigh talk-radio station&quot; in order to start &quot;putting together a <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/69e.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Tape,</a>&quot; although Mr. Z. is good enough on the air that they soon put him on as a paid host.

<blockquote>1996&ndash;1997: Another radio consultant recommends Mr. Z. for a job at WWTN, a Nashville talk station, where he hosts an evening show that makes good Book and is largely hassle-free for several months. Of his brief career at WWTN, the host now feels that &quot;I kind of self-destructed there, actually, in retrospect. I got frustrated with management.

As part of his commentary on the tournament, Mr. Z. posits on-air that Tiger constitutes living proof of the fact that &quot;not all white people are racists.&quot; His supporting argument is that &quot;no white person would ever think of Tiger as a nigger,&quot; because whites draw a mental distinction &quot;between people who just happen to be black and people who act like niggers.&quot; His reason for broadcasting the actual word &quot;nigger&quot;? &quot;This all goes back to O.J. I hated the fact that the media treated viewers and listeners like children by saying &#39;Mark Fuhrman used the N-word.&#39; I despised that, and I think it gives the word too much power. Plus there&#39;s the whole hypocrisy of how black people can use it and white people can&#39;t. I was young and naive and thought I could stand on principle.&quot; As part of that principled stand, Mr. Z. soon redeploys the argument and the word in a discussion of boxer Mike Tyson, whereupon he is fired, &quot;even though there was very little listener reaction.&quot; As Mr. Z. understands it, the reason for his dismissal is that &quot;a single black employee complained,&quot; and WWTN&#39;s parent, &quot;a lily-white company,&quot; feared that it was &quot;very vulnerable&quot; to a discrimination lawsuit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1998&ndash;1999: Mr. Z. works briefly as a morning fill-in at Nashville&#39;s WLAC, whose studios are right across the street from the station that just fired him. From there, he is hired to do overnights at WWDB, an FM talk station in Philadelphia, his home town. There are again auspicious beginnings &hellip; &quot;except my boss, [the P.D. who hired him], is completely unstable and ends up punching out a consultant, and gets fired.

<blockquote>Q: So what exactly is the point of a host&#39;s having a contract if the station can evidently just up and fire you whenever they feel like it?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: &quot;The only thing a contract&#39;s worth in radio is how much they&#39;re going to pay you when they fire you. And if they fire you &#39;For Cause,&#39; then they don&#39;t have to pay you anything.&quot;</blockquote>

Although Comcast is &quot;an evil, evil, evil company, [which] created that network for the sole purpose of giving blowjobs to politicians who vote on Comcast legislation,&quot; Mr. Z. discovers that &quot;I&#39;m actually really good at talk TV. I was the best thing that ever happened to this show.

<blockquote>2002: John Ziegler is hired as the mid-morning host at Clear Channel&#39;s WHAS in Louisville, which Arbitron lists as the fifty-fifth largest radio market in the U.S. According to a local paper, the host&#39;s &quot;stormy, thirteen-month tenure in Louisville was punctuated by intrigue, outrage, controversy and litigation.&quot; According to John Ziegler, &quot;The whole story would make a great movie&mdash;in fact, my whole life would make a great movie, but this in particular would make a great movie.&quot; Densely compressed synopsis: For several quarters, Mr. Z.&#39;s program is a great success in Louisville. &quot;I&#39;m doing huge numbers&mdash;in one Book I got a fifteen share, which is ridiculous.&quot; He is also involved in a very public romance with one Darcie Divita, a former LA Lakers cheerleader who is part of a morning news show on the local Fox TV affiliate.

Part of the enduring controversy over John Ziegler&#39;s firing, which occurs a few days later, is exactly how much those comments and/or subsequent complaints from listeners and the Louisville media had to do with it. Mr. Z. has a long list of reasons for believing that his P.D. was really just looking for an excuse to can him. As for all the complaints, Mr. Z. remains bitter and perplexed: (1) &quot;The comments I made about Darcie&#39;s physical attributes were extremely positive in nature&quot;; (2) &quot;Darcie had, in the past, <i>volunteered</i> information about her cleavage on my program&quot;; (3) &quot;I&#39;ve gone much further with other public figures without incident &hellip; I mocked [Kentucky Governor] Paul Patton for his inability to bring Tina Conner to orgasm, [and] no one from management ever even mentioned it to me.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Z. on talk radio as a career: &quot;This is a terrible business. I&#39;d love to quit this business.&quot; On why, then, he accepted KFI&#39;s offer: &quot;My current contract would be by far the toughest for them to fire me of anyplace I&#39;ve been.&quot;</blockquote>

<p icap="on">Compared with many talk-radio hosts, John Ziegler is unusually polite to on-air callers. Which is to say that he doesn&#39;t yell at them, call them names, or hang up while they&#39;re speaking, although he does get frustrated with some calls. But there are good and bad kinds of frustration, stimulation-wise. Hence the delicate art of call screening. The screener&#39;s little switchboard and computer console are here in the Airmix room, right up next to the studio window.</p>

<p><i>JZS</i> Producer Emiliano Limon: &quot;There are two types of callers.

<p>Vince isn&#39;t rude or brusque with the callers he screens out; he simply becomes more and more laconic and <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/72b.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">stoned-sounding</a> over the headset as the person rants on, and finally says, &quot;Whoa, gotta go.&quot; Especially obnoxious and persistent callers can be placed on Hold at the screener&#39;s switchboard, locking up their phones until Vince decides to let them go. Those whom the screener lets through enter a different, computerized Hold system in which eight callers at a time can be kept queued up and waiting, each designated on Mr. Z.&#39;s monitor by a different colored box displaying a first name, city, one-sentence summary of the caller&#39;s thesis, and the total time waiting. The host chooses, cafeteria-style, from this array.</p>

<p>In his selections, Mr. Z. has an observable preference for female callers. Emiliano&#39;s explanation: &quot;Since political talk radio is so white male&mdash;driven, it&#39;s good to get female voices in there.&quot; It turns out that this is an industry convention; the roughly 50-50 gender mix of callers one hears on most talk radio is because screeners admit a much higher percentage of female callers to the system.</p>

<p>One of the last things that Emiliano Limon always does before airtime is to use the station&#39;s <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/72c.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">NexGen Audio Editing System</a> to load various recorded sound bites from the day&#39;s broadcast news onto a Prophet file that goes with the Cut Sheet. This is a numbered list of bites available for tonight&#39;s <i>John Ziegler Show</i>, of which both Mr. Z. and &#39;Mondo get a copy. Each bite must be precisely timed. It is an intricate, exacting process of editing and compilation, during which Mr. Z. often drums his fingers and looks pointedly at his watch as the producer ignores him and always very slowly and placidly edits and compresses and loads and has the Cut Sheet ready at the very last second. Emiliano is the sort of extremely chilled-out person who can seem to be leaning back at his station with his feet up on the Airmix table even when he isn&#39;t leaning back at all. He&#39;s wearing the <i>LA Times</i> shirt again. His own view on listener calls is that they are &quot;overrated in talk radio,&quot; that they&#39;re rarely all that cogent or stimulating, but that hosts tend to be &quot;overconcerned with taking calls and whether people are calling. Consider: This is the only type of live performance with absolutely no feedback from the audience. It&#39;s natural for the host to key in on the only real-time response he can get, which is the calls. It takes a long time with a host to get him to forget about the calls, to realize the calls have very little to do with the wider audience.&quot;</p>

<p>Vince, meanwhile, is busy at the screener&#39;s station. A lady with a heavy accent keeps calling in to say that she has vital information: a Czech newspaper has revealed that John Kerry is actually a Jew, that his grandfather changed his distinctively Jewish surname, and that this fact is being suppressed in the U.S. media and must be exposed. Vince finally tries putting her on punitive Hold, but her line&#39;s light goes out, which signifies that the lady has a cell phone and has disengaged by simply turning it off. Meaning that she can call back again as much as she likes, and that Vince is going to have to get actively rude. &#39;Mondo&#39;s great mild eyes rise from the board: <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/72d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;<i>Puto</i>,</a> man, what&#39;s that about?&quot; Vince, very flat and bored: &quot;Kerry&#39;s a Jew.&quot; Emiliano: &quot;Another big advent is the cell phone.

<p icap="on">Historically, the two greatest ratings periods ever for KFI AM-640 have been the Gray Davis gubernatorial recall and the O.J. Simpson trial. Now, in early June &#39;04, the tenth anniversary of the Ron Goldman/Nicole Brown Simpson murders is approaching, and O.J. starts to pop up once again on the cultural radar. And Mr. John Ziegler happens to be <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/73a.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">more passionate about the O.J. Simpson thing</a> than maybe any other single issue, and feels that he &quot;know[s] more about the case than anyone not directly involved,&quot; and is able to be almost unbearably stimulating about O.J. Simpson and the utter indubitability of his guilt. And the confluence of the murders&#39; anniversary, the case&#39;s tabloid importance to the nation and business importance to KFI, and its deep personal resonance for Mr. Z. helps produce what at first looks like the absolute Monster talk-radio story of the month.</p>

<p>On June 3, in the third segment of the <i>John Ziegler Show</i>&#39;s second hour, after lengthy discussions of the O.J. anniversary and the Michael Jackson case, Mr. Z. takes a phone call from one &quot;Daryl in Temecula,&quot; an African-American gentleman who is &quot;absolutely astounded they let a Klansman on the radio this time of night.&quot; The call, which lasts seven minutes and eighteen seconds and <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/73b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">runs well over the :46 break,</a> ends with John Ziegler&#39;s telling the audience, &quot;That&#39;s as angry as I&#39;ve ever gotten in the history of my career.&quot; And Vince Nicholas, looking awed and spent at his screener&#39;s station, pronounces the whole thing &quot;some of the best talk radio I ever heard.&quot;</p>

<p>Some portions of the call are untranscribable because they consist mainly of Daryl and Mr. Z. trying to talk over each other. Daryl&#39;s core points appear to be (1) that Mr. Z. seems to spend all his time talking about black men like Kobe and O.J. and Michael Jackson&mdash;&quot;Don&#39;t white people commit crimes?&quot;&mdash;and (2) that O.J. was, after all, found innocent in a court of law, and yet Mr. Z. keeps &quot;going on about &#39;He&#39;s guilty, he&#39;s guilty&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He <i>is</i>,&quot; the host inserts.</p>

<p>Daryl: &quot;He was acquitted, wasn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p><a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/73c.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;That makes no difference as to whether or not he did it.&quot;</a></p>

<p>&quot;O.J., Kobe: You just thrive on these black guys.&quot;</p>

<p>It is here that Mr. Z. begins to pick up steam. &quot;Oh yeah, Daryl, right, I&#39;m a racist. As a matter of fact, I often say, &#39;You know what? I just wish another black guy would commit a crime, because I hate black people so much.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Daryl: &quot;I think you do have more to talk about on black guys. I think that&#39;s more &#39;<i>news</i>&#39;&quot; &hellip; which actually would be kind of an interesting point to explore, or at least address; but Mr. Z. is now stimulated.</p>

<p>&quot;As a matter of fact, Daryl, oftentimes when we go through who&#39;s committed the crimes, there are times when the white people who control the media, we get together and go, &#39;Oh, we can&#39;t talk about that one, because that was a white guy.&#39; This is all a big conspiracy, Daryl. Except, to be serious for a second, Daryl, what really upsets me, assuming you&#39;re a black guy, is that you ought to be <i>ten</i> times more pissed off at O.J. Simpson than I am, because you know why?&quot;</p>

<p>Daryl: &quot;You can&#39;t tell me how I should feel. As a forty-year-old black man, I&#39;ve seen racism for forty years.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Z. is starting to move his upper body back and forth excitedly in his chair. &quot;I bet you have. I bet you have. And here&#39;s why you ought to be pissed off: Because, out of all the black guys who <i>deserved</i> to get a benefit of the doubt because of the history of racism which is real in this country, and which is insidious, the one guy&mdash;<i>the one guy</i>&mdash;who gets <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/73f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">the benefit of all of that pain and suffering</a> over <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/73g.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">a hundred</a> years of history in this country is the one guy who deserves it less than anybody else, who sold his race out, who tried to talk white, who only had white friends, who had his <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/74a.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">ass kissed all over the place</a> because he decided he wasn&#39;t really a black guy, who was the <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/74b.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">first person</a> in the history of this country ever accepted by white America, who was actually able to do commercial endorsements because he pretended to be white, and <i>that&#39;s the guy?

<p icap="on">And then June 4, the night following the Daryl interchange, turns out to be a climactic whirlwind of production challenges, logistical brinksmanship, meta-media outrage, Simpsonian minutiae, and Monster-grade stimulation. As is <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/74g.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">SOP, it starts around 7:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">p.m.</span></a> in KFI&#39;s large central prep room, which is where all the local hosts and their producers come in to prepare for their shows.</p>

<p>The prep room, which station management sometimes refers to as the production office, is more or less the nerve center of KFI, a large, complexly shaped space perimetered with battered little canted desks and hutches and two-drawer file cabinets supporting tabletops of composite planking. There are beat-up computers and pieces of sound equipment and funny Scotch-taped bits of office humor (e.g., pictures with staffers&#39; heads Photoshopped onto tabloid celebrities&#39; bodies). Like the studio and Airmix, the <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/74h.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">prep room</a> is also a D.P.H.-grade mess: half the overhead fluorescents are either out or flickering nauseously, and the gray carpet crunches underfoot, and the wastebaskets are all towering fire hazards, and many of the tabletops are piled with old <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/74i.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">books</a> and newspapers. One window, which is hot to the touch, overlooks KFI&#39;s gated parking lot and security booth and the office of a Korean podiatrist across the street.</p>

<p>Overall, the layout and myriad tactical functions of the prep room are too complicated to try to describe this late in the game. At one end, it gives on to the KFI newsroom, which is a whole galaxy unto itself. At the other, comparatively uncluttered end is a set of thick, distinguished-looking doors leading off into the offices of the Station Manager, Director of Marketing &amp; Promotions, <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/75a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">Program Director,</a> and so on, with also a semi-attached former closet for the P.D.&#39;s assistant, a very kindly and eccentric lady who&#39;s been at KFI for over twenty years and wears a high-tech headset that one begins, only over time, to suspect isn&#39;t really connected to anything.</p>

<p>There are three main challenges facing tonight&#39;s <i>John Ziegler Show</i>. One is that Emiliano Limon is off on certain personal business that he doesn&#39;t want described, and therefore Mr. Vince Nicholas is soloing as producer for the very first time. Another is that last night&#39;s on-air exchange with Daryl of Temecula is the type of intensely stimulating talk-radio event that cries out for repetition and commentary; Mr. Z. wants to rerun certain snippets of the call in a very precise order so that he can use them as jumping-off points for detailing his own &quot;history with O.J.&quot; and explaining why he&#39;s so incandescently passionate about the case.</p>

<p>The third difficulty is that Simpson&#39;s big anniversary Q &amp; A with Ms. Katie Couric is airing tonight on NBC&#39;s <i>Dateline</i>, and the cuts and discussions of the Daryl call are going to have to be interwoven with excerpts from what Mr. Z. refers to several times as &quot;Katie&#39;s blowjob interview.&quot; An additional complication is that <i>Dateline</i> airs in Los Angeles from 8:00 to 10:00 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">p.m.</span>, and it has also now run teases for stories on the health hazards of the Atkins diet and the dangerously lax security in U.S. hotels. Assuming that <i>Dateline</i> waits and does the O.J. interview last (which it is clearly in the program&#39;s interests to do), then the interview&#39;s highlights will have to be recorded off TiVo, edited on NexGen, loaded onto Prophet, and queued up for the Cut Sheet <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/75b.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">all very quickly,</a> since Mr. Z.&#39;s opening segment starts at 10:06 and it&#39;s hard to fiddle with logistics once his show&#39;s under way.</p>

<p>Thus Vince spends 7:00&mdash;8:00 working two side-by-side computers, trying simultaneously to assemble the cuts from last night&#39;s call, load an MSNBC interview with Nicole Brown Simpson&#39;s sister directly into NexGen, and track down a Web transcript of tonight&#39;s <i>Dateline</i> (which on the East Coast has already aired) so that he and Mr. Z. can choose and record bites from the Couric thing in real time. &#39;Mondo, who is back board-opping the ISDN feed of 7:00&mdash;10:00&#39;s <i>Phil Hendrie Show</i>, nevertheless comes in from Airmix several times to stand behind Vince at the terminals, ostensibly to see what&#39;s going on but really to lend moral support. &#39;Mondo&#39;s shadow takes up almost half the room&#39;s east wall.</p>

<p>John Ziegler, who is understandably quite keyed up, spends some of the pre-<i>Dateline</i> time standing around with an extremely pretty News-department intern named Kyra, watching the MSNBC exchange with half an eye while doing his trademark stress-relieving thing of <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/75c.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">holding two golf balls</a> and trying to align the dimples so that one ball stays balanced atop the other. He is wearing a horizontally striped green-and-white golf shirt, neatly pressed black shorts, and gleaming New Balance sneakers. He keeps saying that he cannot be<i>lieve</i> they&#39;re even giving Simpson air time. No one points out that his shock seems a bit naive given the business realities of network TV news, realities about which John Ziegler is normally very savvy and cynical. Kyra does venture to observe, quietly, that the Simpson thing draws even bigger ratings than today&#39;s Scott Peterson, who&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t even compare the two,&quot; Mr. Z. cuts her off. &quot;O.J.&#39;s just in his own world in terms of arrogance.&quot;</p>

<p>The designated <i>JZS</i> intern, meanwhile, is at the prep room&#39;s <i>John &amp; Ken Show</i> computer, working (in Vince&#39;s stead) on a comic review feature called &quot;What Have We Learned This Week?,&quot; which is normally a Friday standard but which there may or may not be time for tonight. At 7:45 <span style="text-transform: uppercase">p.m.</span> it is still 90&deg; out, and smoggy. The windows&#39; light makes peoplelook greenish in the areas where the room&#39;s fluorescents are low. A large spread of <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">takeout chicken</a> sits <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76b.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">uneaten and expensively congealing.</a> Mr. Z.&#39;s <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76c.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">intern</a> spends nearly an hour composing a mock poem to Ms. Amber Frey, the mistress to whom Scott Peterson evidently read romantic verse over the phone. The poem&#39;s final version, which is &quot;Roses are red / Violets are blue / If I find out you&#39;re pregnant / I&#39;ll drown your ass too,&quot; takes such a long time because of confusions about the right conjugation of &quot;to drown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to top it off,&quot; Mr. Z. is telling Kyra as her smile becomes brittle and she starts trying to edge away, &quot;to top it off, he leaves Nicole&#39;s body in a place where the most likely people to find it are his <i>children</i>. It&#39;s just a fluke that couple found her. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever walked by <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76d.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">there,</a> but it&#39;s really dark at night, and they were in a, like [gesturing, one golf ball in each hand], cave formation out at the front.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure enough, <i>Dateline</i> runs the anti-Atkins story first. For reasons involving laser printers and a special editing room off the on-air news cubicle, there&#39;s suddenly a lot of running back and forth.</p>

<p>In Airmix, &#39;Mondo is eating Koo Koo Roo&#39;s chicken while watching Punk&#39;d, an MTV show where friends of young celebrities collude with the producers to make the celebrities think they&#39;re in terrible legal trouble. &#39;Mondo is very careful about eating anywhere near the mixing board. It&#39;s always around 60&deg; in this room. On the board&#39;s channel 6 and the overhead speakers, Phil Hendrie is pretending to mediate between <a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76e.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">apoplectic callers</a> and a man who&#39;s filing sexual-harassment charges against female co-workers who&#39;ve gotten breast implants. For unknown reasons, a waist-high pile of disconnected computer keyboards has appeared in the Airmix room&#39;s north corner, just across the wall from KFI&#39;s Imaging studio, whose door is always double-locked.</p>

<p>It is only right that John Ziegler gets the spot directly in front of the prep room&#39;s TV, with everyone else&#39;s office chairs sort of fanned out to either side behind him. Seated back on his tailbone with his legs out and ankles crossed, Mr. Z. is able simultaneously to watch <i>Dateline</i>&#39;s are-you-in-danger-at-luxury-hotels segment, to hear and help rearrange Vince&#39;s cuts from the MSNBC exchange, and to highlight those parts of the O.J.&ndash;Katie Couric <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">transcript</a> that he wants to make absolutely sure to have Vince load from TiVo into Prophet when the greedy bastards at <i>Dateline</i> finally air the interview. It must be said, too, that Vince is an impressive surprise as a producer. He&#39;s a veritable blur of all-business competence and technical savvy. There are none of Emiliano&#39;s stoic shrugs, <i>sotto</i> wisecracks, or passive-aggressive languor. Nor, tonight, is Vince&#39;s own slackerish stoner persona anywhere in view. It is the same type of change as when you put a fish back in the water and it seems to turn electric in your hand. Watching Vince and the host work so well as a team induces the night&#39;s first strange premonitory jolt: Emiliano&#39;s <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76g.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">days are numbered.</a></p>

<p>The broadcast studio is strange when no one&#39;s in here. Through the soundproof window, &#39;Mondo&#39;s head looks small and far away as he inclines over the spot log. It seems like a lonely, cloistered place in which to be passionate about the world. Mr. Z.&#39;s padded host chair is old and lists slightly to port; it&#39;s the same chair that John Kobylt sits in, and morning drive&#39;s Bill Handel, and maybe even Dr. Laura back in the day. The studio wastebaskets have been emptied, but the banana scent still lingers. It might simply be that John and/or Ken <a class="pink" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/76h.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">eats a lot of bananas</a> during afternoon drive. All the studio&#39;s monitors are on, though none is tuned to NBC. On the Fox News monitor up over the digital clock, Sean Hannity and Susan Estrich are rerunning the Iowa Caucuses clip of Howard Dean screaming at the start of his concession speech. They play the scream over and over. Ms. Estrich is evidently filling in on <i>Hannity and Colmes</i>. &quot;They have hatred for George W. Bush, but they don&#39;t have ideas,&quot; Sean Hannity says. &quot;Where are the ideas on the left? Where is the thinking liberal?&quot; Susan Estrich says, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have a full-time job on TV, so I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>All multi-tasking ends when <i>Dateline</i>, after two teases and an extra-long spot break, <a class="blue" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77a.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">finally commences the interview segment.</a> It is Katie Couric and O.J. Simpson and Simpson&#39;s attorney in a living room that may or may not be real. One tends to forget how unusually, screen-fillingly large O.J.&#39;s head is. Mr. Ziegler is now angled forward with his elbows on his knees and his fingers steepled just under his nose. Although he does, every so often, let loose with a &quot;Katie Couric <i>sucks!</i>&quot; or &quot;Katie Couric should be fucking <i>shot!</i>,&quot; for the most part a person seated on the host&#39;s far flank has to watch his upper face&mdash;his right eye&#39;s and nostril&#39;s dilations&mdash;to discern when Mr. Z.&#39;s reacting strongly or thinking about how he&#39;ll respond to some specific bit of Simpson&#39;s &quot;sociopathic BS&quot; when it&#39;s his turn to talk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s odd: if you&#39;ve spent some time watching Mr. Z. perform in the studio, you can predict just what he&#39;ll look like, how his head and arms will move and eyes fill with life as he says certain things that it&#39;s all but sure he&#39;ll say on-air tonight, such as <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;I have some very, very strong opinions about how this interview was conducted,&quot;</a> and <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;Katie Couric is a disgrace to journalism everywhere,&quot;</a> and that O.J.&#39;s self-presentation was <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;delusional and arrogant beyond all belief,&quot;</a> and that the original trial jury was <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;a collection of absolute nimrods,&quot;</a> and that to believe in Simpson&#39;s innocence, as Ms. Couric says a poll shows some 70 percent of African-Americans still do, <a class="orange" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77b.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&quot;you have to be either crazy, deluded, or stupid&mdash;there are no other explanations.&quot;</a></p>

<p>To be fair, though, there truly are some dubious, unsettling things about the <a class="green" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77d.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink"><i>Dateline</i> interview,</a> such as for instance that NBC has acceded to O.J. Simpson&#39;s &quot;no editing&quot; condition for appearing, which used to be an utter taboo for serious news organizations. Or that O.J. gets to sit there looking cheery and unguarded even though he has his lawyer almost in his lap; or that most of Katie Couric&#39;s questions turn out to be Larry King&mdash;size fluffballs; or that O.J. Simpson responds to one of her few substantive questions&mdash;about 1994&#39;s eerie, slow-motion Bronco chase and its bearing on how O.J.&#39;s case is still perceived&mdash;by harping on the fact that the chase &quot;never ever, in three trials that I had, it never came up,&quot; as if that had anything to do with whatever his behavior in the Bronco really signified (and at which non-answer, and Ms. Couric&#39;s failure to press or follow up, Mr. Z. moans and smears his hand up and down over his face).<a class="red" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77e.html','bigsidebar','width=440,height=400,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> Or that O.J.&#39;s cheerful expression never changes when Katie Couric, leaning forward and speaking with a delicacy that&#39;s <a class="purple" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77f.html','bigsidebar','width=330,height=300,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">either decent or obscene,</a> inquires whether his children ever ask him about the crime. And when someone in the arc of chairs around John Ziegler says, almost to himself, that the one pure thing to hope for here is that Simpson&#39;s kids believe he&#39;s innocent, Mr. Z. gives a snort of reply and states, very flatly, &quot;They know, and he knows they know, that he did it.&quot; To which, in KFI&#39;s prep room, <a class="chartreuse" href="" onclick="window.open('/static/coma/html/200504-wallace/77g.html','bigsidebar','width=220,height=200,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,left=60,top=40,screenX=60,screenY=40');return false;" target="outlink">the best response would probably be compassion, empathy.</a> Because one can almost feel it: what a bleak and merciless world this host lives in&mdash;believes, nay, knows for an absolute <i>fact</i> he lives in.
